\begin{abstract}
In this paper we solve stylized problems in  
onedimensional screening without the single-crossing condition. With the aid of numerical optimization tools, we guess which are the relevant binding incentive compatibility constraints. Then we use this information to build a candidate solution that matches the numerical pattern.
